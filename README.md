#Purpose of the project: 
We want to protect people who are currently threatened by criminals!
Recently, we’ve heard a lot of news about women and children got robbed, raped or even in different areas. Sometimes things just went bad so fast that the victims have little chance to call for help. We want to help those who could face danger someday. Therefore, we decide to develop a mobile application to protect those who are under attack. 


#Technical Implementation:
So for now, “Danger Alert” is an android application. We use Android Studio as the main developing software and Java as the programming language. For the location part, we used the GPS of the mobile phone to get the current location and Google Maps API to get the address.  We choose IBM Bluemix to create the on-cloud database for the record of recent criminal incidents. JDBC is used to connect the database into the application.

#Functions:
The application will record the user’s location in real time. When a user is in danger, he or she can press the volume button to call the police and send the SOS message and the location information to friends and family immediately. 
Besides, we also build a database to save all records on incidents and the time and location that they occurred. Notifications will be pushed to users when they reach an area with multiple recent records, which will be categorized as “dangerous”.
